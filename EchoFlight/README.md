# EchoFlight
 Short puzzle game project about a bat navigating obstacles with drag and drop player input. 
This is a short, personal project I was inspired to start after spotting several bats flying overhead one night driving home. I was rather thrilled to see them, as their numbers had been declining in recent years, so I started thinking about making a game about them.

The core concept is a puzzle game partially inspired from the drag 'n drop style of Scratch (although this is being made in Unity/C#). Players must navigate their bat through obstacles selecting arrow pieces the dictate what direction the bat will go. As a nod to real-life bat behavior, the obstacles are revealed by "echo-location", which will translate as a game mechanic to players choosing and firing an echo-location beam to reveal parts of the level. Players get one "free" echo-location reveal of the whole level at the start, and then each subsquent firing will reveal only part of the level and decrease the player's score, adding an aspect of memorization-type puzzle as an element. Players can increase their score by navigating to various bugs to eat on the level map.
